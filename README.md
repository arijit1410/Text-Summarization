# Text-Summarization

## A little comparitive case study for text summarization.

For out experiment, we have scraped an online tech article discussing the pros and cons of the OnePlus 7 smartphone and giving a final review on it.

## Summaries

### TextRank [1]

It’s still one of the best looking designs available, but the notch is more intrusive than the holepunch design of the Honor 20 or similar, and not quite on the same level as the OnePlus 7 Pro.The phone is only available in mirror grey in the UK, which is super-shiny with a slight purple tint to it.
That meant the OnePlus 7 would make it from 7am on day one until 4pm on day two, or longer with lighter use or one of the power-saving modes active.There’s no wireless charging, but OnePlus’s included fast charging tech will hit 80% in 50 minutes and a full battery in 90 minutes.
OnePlus gives you the choice of choice standard three-button Android navigation keys, Google’s “pill” navigation button or gestures, which are smooth – swipe up from the centre to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or up and over to the right for the previously-used app.
Both smartphones have seen a barrage of recent software updates that have improved the cameras – something that’s very good to see.
The main camera is just as good as the 7 Pro, capturing some really detailed and well-exposed shots.

### Skip-Thoughts [2][3]

As such, the phone flies. For comparison, the OnePlus 7 is 24g lighter, 1.1mm narrower and 4.9mm shorter than the larger OnePlus 7 Pro, but 7g heavier than the similarly sized Samsung Galaxy S10. It’s still one of the best looking designs available, but the notch is more intrusive than the holepunch design of the Honor 20 or similar, and not quite on the same level as the OnePlus 7 Pro.The phone is only available in mirror grey in the UK, which is super-shiny with a slight purple tint to it. As such, it is one of the best versions of Android you can get, and you can look forward to three years of software updates from release, including bi-monthly security updates. The rest of the dimensions compare favourably to the competition. Video capture is pretty good at up to 4K60Hz, as is the selfie camera, which captures more detail than most might want.

### Online Article Summary


From the highs of the OnePlus 7 Pro, the “non-Pro” OnePlus 7 may look like a consolation prize, but in many ways the OnePlus 7 is better because it holds true to the winning OnePlus formula: exceptional bang for your buck. It’s smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to use while still being a big-screen phone. It’s just as powerful, has the same great software and same smooth performance, and has a longer battery life than its Pro sibling. It even has the same unrivalled in-screen fingerprint sensor and great main camera. But if you were looking for a multi-camera, zoom in and out affair, this isn’t it. And while the screen looks great, it isn’t the same game-changing, addictively silky smooth display on the OnePlus 7 Pro. What you get for your £500 with the OnePlus 7 is a brilliant phone with an experience unrivalled anywhere near this price. It’s so good that there are only a few non-5G phones I would consider over this, and even then it’s a close call.
